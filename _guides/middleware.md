# Middleware functions

> Multiple middleware functions can be registered with a router instance. They are invoked in series after the router has made sure active
route segments can be deactivated and future active route segments can be activated. Middleware functions are a great way to load data for your routes.

## Registering middleware functions

A middleware is a function taking a router instance and returning a function which will be called on each transition (unless a transition failed at the _canActivate_ or _canDeactivate_ state).

A middleware function can return a boolean for synchronous results, a promise or call
a done callback for asynchronous operations. If it returns false, a rejected promise or a callback with an error, it will fail the transition.

This type of function is ideal to remove data loading logic from components, and is a good fit
for applications aiming at having a centralised state object.

```javascript
const mware1 = router => (toState, fromState, done) => {
    // Let's fetch data and call done
    done();
};

const mware2 = router => (toState, fromState, done) => {
    // Let's fetch data and call done
    done();
};

router.useMiddleware(mware1, mware2);
```

> Calling `useMiddleware` again will cause previously registered middleware functions to be deregistered.

## Adding data to state

It is possible to mutate the `toState` object by adding properties, or to pass a new state object in callbacks or promises.
When passing a new object, the router will ignore it if initial state properties (`name`, `params` and `path`) are changed.

```javascript
import { getData } from './dataApi';

const dataLoader = router =>
    (toState, fromState) =>
        // toState object will be extended with data values
        getData().then(data => ({ ...toState, ...data }));
```

## Custom errors

When failing a transition in a middleware function, custom errors can be returned. Custom errors can be a string or an object:
- when a string, the router will return ```{ code: 'TRANSITION_ERR', error: '<your string>'}```
- when an object, the returned error object will be extended with your error object ```{ code: 'TRANSITION_ERR', ...errorObject }```
